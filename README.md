## ðŸ§± Architecture Overview

The project follows **Clean Architecture**:

```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/                  # Theme, helpers, constants
â”œâ”€â”€ features/              # Feature-based structure
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ onboarding/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ home/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ domain/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ presentation/
â””â”€â”€ main.dart
```

### State Management
- Managed using `flutter_bloc`
- Each feature has its own bloc, event, and state
- All states are immutable (using `copyWith()`)

---

## ðŸ”— Firebase Integration
- **Authentication**: Login and Register with email/password
- Uses `firebase_core` and `firebase_auth`

## ðŸ’¾ Local Storage
- Hive is used to store onboarding completion status
- Configured via `hive` and `hive_flutter`

---

## ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX
- Responsive UI built with `flutter_screenutil`
- Native splash screen via `flutter_native_splash`
- App launcher icon via `flutter_launcher_icons`
